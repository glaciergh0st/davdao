## Introduction

#### “<em>AI would make it easier done than said, so don’t say it’s easier said than done.</em>”


A close friend, a scientist, said those words to me this morning, and they’ve been resonating in my thoughts all day. From GitHub Copilot to performing the most advanced quantitative analysis in minutes, many consulting firms face disruption and will be forced to reshape their operations.

In the security space, we could fully transition into an era of Compressed Attack Campaigns and High-Velocity StealthOps.

## Technology Adoption Patterns
First, let us briefly summarize a few important trends we have seen in the last decade:

- **Post-Quantum Standards (PQC)** - aggressive push for standards that are accompanied with the usual “back doors”
- **Blockchain** - slow adoption due to its trustless, decentralized nature that challenges traditional control models.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - rapidly embraced and integrated, particularly by those who benefit from centralized power.
- **Quantum + AI (QAI)** - poised to become the most powerful capability in security, finance, and military intelligence, with the potential to reshape control, influence, and strategic dominance.
#

### Immediate Catalysts for Concern
- LLM-driven autonomous attacks are no longer theoretical. Proof-of-concept chains now execute full intrusion workflows with “minimal” human input.
- An increasingly common trend in stories like [**HexStrike**](https://github.com/0x4m4/hexstrike-ai) and [**XBOW HackerOne leaderboard jump**](https://xbow.com/blog/xbow-on-hackerone-whats-next) highlight how quickly skilled operators can leverage AI-driven toolchains to dominate vulnerability discovery and exploitation at scale.

## Strategic Risk Question
What happens when hostile actors gain QAI capabilities while an organization is still:  
- Operating with AI-based defensive systems, and  
- Placing complete trust in PQC and other standards without continuous validation?  

Some organizations are not even keeping pace with the latest security developments - a critical vulnerability in itself.

## Most Impactful Security Mindset moving forward:
1. **Zero Trust Architecture:** The default baseline.
2. **AI-Adaptive Adversarial Thinking**: Continuously evaluate defenses by simulating AI-driven threats, preparing for evolving adversaries rather than relying on narrow metrics or predictable patterns.
3. **Intensify current secure SDLC and DevSecOps practices:** Rigorous code reviews, hardened trust relationships, strict dependency controls, and continuous third-party risk control can counter against AI-assisted coding risks, vulnerable dependencies, and emerging AI-driven threat actors.  
4. **No complacency:** Treat security as an evolving arms race, not a completed project.

## Top 4 Skills Needed to Thrive in an AI-Dominated Space

For non-decision makers, most roles will shift from human-driven operations toward **overseeing, verifying, and augmenting AI**.

1. **LLM/AI Security & Red-Teaming**  
   Traditional team exercises will gradually become limited and outdated. A critical skill is developing and overseeing **AI-powered adversarial emulation frameworks** to test and protect AI-reliant organizations against evolving AI-driven threats.

2. **AI Model Auditing & Governance**  
   As AI becomes core to operations, organizations must adhere to **AI safety standards and compliance policies**, making auditing and governance a critical skill to prevent legal and operational risks.

3. **AI-Augmented Threat Hunting**  
   Using AI to enhance detection, analysis, and response, enabling faster and more accurate threat identification.

4. **AI-Driven Adversary Emulation**  
   Simulating sophisticated attacks using AI to proactively identify vulnerabilities and strengthen defenses.

## Conclusion
AI is not an absolute threat. It’s an opportunity to be pioneers and future hall-of-famers. By combining new AI skills with decades of classical security experience, the direction of the next generation of cyber defense and adversarial tactics rests in your hands.

AI may surpass the skills benchmark of a principal security researcher or SME with only a few months of training, and when given a century’s worth of currently available security playbook, it can become highly creative and semi-intuitive. 
Nonetheless, **every organization’s risk profile, priorities, and resource constraints demand a degree of contextual judgment that remains uniquely human.** This understanding is essential to both decision makers and non-decision makers.
